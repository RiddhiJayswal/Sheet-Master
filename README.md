# Sheet Master

## Description
This project is a **Sheet Master**, built from scratch using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It provides a set of features similar to a basic spreadsheet application allowing users to perform a variety of tasks like data entry, calculations, and text formatting. This application also includes a formula bar for complex calculations and a 2D grid layout making it user-friendly.

## Features
- **2D Grid Layout**: Includes rows, columns, and multiple sheets for data organization.
- **Formula and Address Bar**: Supports complex calculations and cell referencing through a formula bar.
- **Text Formatting**: Allows users to change font size, font type, alignment, and other text styling options.
- **Formula Evaluation**: Implements formulas using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm and evaluates expressions using infix stack evaluation.
